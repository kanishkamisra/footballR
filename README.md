R codes for some football(soccer) analytics

# To-do
1. Get the right data, currently I have a SQLite file from Kaggle that has data from the 2008/09 season to part of 2015/16 season.
2. If I stick with the Kaggle dataset, it'll need heavy tidying and wrangling to fit a desirable model (all hail lord Hadley)
3. Apply bayesian principles to the tidied data learned in David Robinson's blog, [variance explained](http://varianceexplained.org "Variance Explained")
4. Expand on this brief to-do xd
